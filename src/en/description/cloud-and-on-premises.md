## Setting Up the DV.net Crypto Merchant: Cloud vs. On-Premise Server

The decision on how to integrate a service for accepting cryptocurrency payments (crypto merchant) is one of the key 
questions when creating an online business. The choice between **deployment on your own server (on-premise)** and 
**using the cloud version** determines not only the initial costs but also the level of control, security, 
and scalability of your project.

This guide will help you conduct a comprehensive comparison of the two approaches so you can make an informed decision 
based on the needs and capabilities of your business.


## üìä Comparison Table: On-Premise Server vs. Cloud

The following table clearly illustrates the key differences between the two approaches:

| Criterion | Installation on Your Own Server (On-Premise) | Cloud Version |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Costs** | Costs for server rental/purchase, Internet access channel rental, server setup, updates, and maintenance, and blockchain transaction fees. | Costs only for blockchain transaction fees. |
| **Control** | Full control over the environment and data. | Limited control over your data. |
| **Security** | Full responsibility rests on you: you must independently ensure physical and cybersecurity and install updates. | Responsibility is shared with us; we provide infrastructure protection, including DDoS protection. |
| **Availability & Reliability** | Risk of downtime due to equipment failures; creating a fault-tolerant infrastructure is expensive. | High reliability and availability are ensured by us. |
| **Merchant Updates** | Managing updates is simple, and you control the updates. | Updates are performed by us automatically. |


## üíª DV.net On-Premise Installation: Full Control and Responsibility

This approach implies that you independently install and configure the crypto merchant software on your physical 
or virtual server, for which you bear full responsibility. The basic installation is very simple, automated, 
and takes no more than 3 minutes. Extended configuration is thoroughly documented.

### Advantages of the Approach
- **Absolute Control**: You have complete control over every aspect of the system‚Äîfrom operating system and software 
versions to firewall configuration and security policies. This allows you to perfectly adapt the system to your 
unique requirements.
- **Data Security**: All data, including encrypted seed phrases and transaction history, is stored on your own media 
and is not transmitted to a third party. This is critically important for companies handling data subject to strict 
regulatory requirements.
- **Performance**: With proper hardware configuration, you can achieve consistently low **latency** and 
high **performance**, as server resources are not shared with other users.

### Complexities and Risks
- **Ongoing Operational Costs**: These include costs for electricity, cooling, facility rental (if applicable), 
and, importantly, the salary of qualified system administrators.
- **Backup**: Only you have access to your data, so ensuring system **backup** falls entirely on your shoulders.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è DV.net Cloud Version: Flexibility and Resource Savings

The cloud solution involves using a ready-made service provided by us. You use the platform via an **API** or web 
interface without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### Key Advantages
- **Reliability and Availability**: Our data centers are equipped with redundancy at all levels. This guarantees high 
- service **availability** (often 99.9% and higher), which is difficult and expensive to organize independently. 
- In the event of failures, our team handles the problem resolution.
- **Focus on Business**: You don't need to divert resources to maintaining and updating the server infrastructure. 
- This allows your team to focus on business development and improving the user experience.

### Potential Drawbacks
- **Limited Control**: Your seed phrases are encrypted but stored on our servers.
